Contribution Statement 

Fan Yang   
+ Extracted RGB and GIST features.  
+ Tuned RGB hyper parameters and corresponding xgboost model parameters.  
+ Wrote the main adaboost cross validation functions.   
+ Compared different model performance.  
+ Created structure of project and organized GitHub directory.
+ Made presentation.  

Yiran Jiang   
+ Established and optimized Convolution Neural Network (CNN/Python) model.  
+ Made data preprocessing and tested on the Neural Network.   
+ Implemented all connection of Python code and CNN model with .Rmd files.   
+ Provided visualized results of different models.   
+ Conducted memory comparisons between different models.  
+ Wrote main.Rmd file and added connections to all other functions.  

Jingyi Wang   
+ Modified `README.md`     
+ Established and optimized the Baseline model.  
+ Tuned the baseline model parameters and used heatmap for visualizing its results.  
+ Established xgboost model, tuned the parameters for xgboost model under SIFT, GIST and RGB features.   
+ Wrote train, test and cross_validation functions, combined above functions with .Rmd files.  
+ Added more details to presentation slides.  

Xueyao Li   
+ Established and optimized linear SVM and RBF SVM model.  
+ Tuned parameters for SVM model and visualized the results by line or heatmap.   
+ Conducted time and cv error comparison between different models.
+ Helped making presentation slides.  
+ Wrote readme file.
