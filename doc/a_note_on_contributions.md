### A Note on Contributions

Whenever we have team projects, there are always concerns on unequal contributions from members of a project team. In the ideal world, we are all here to put in our best efforts and learn together. Even in that ideal world, we have different skill sets and preparations, and we will still contribute differently to a project. 

Therefore, you are required to post a *contribution statement* in the root README.md of your GitHub repo. Please beware that your GitHub repo will become public and remain public after the due date of the projects. 

Post your title, team members, project abstract and a contribution statement in the README.md file.  This is a common practice for research scientific journals. 

Below is an example. If no contribution statement is provided, we will insert a default statement that goes "**All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement**. "

Sample project README statement.

Project 3

Team members: Fan Yang; Yiran Jiang; Jingyi Wang; Xueyao Li

Summary: In this project, we developed a new method and improved the classification accuracy for images of cats and dogs to 99.9%

[Contribution Statement] 

Fan Yang - Extracted RGB and GIST features; tuned rgb hyper parameters and corresponding xgboost model parameters. Wrote the main adaboost cross validation functions; compared different model performance; created structure of project and organized GitHub directory; made presentation.

Yiran Jiang - Established and optimized Convolution Neural Network(CNN/Python) model; made data preprocessing and tested on the Neural Network; implemented all connection of Python code and CNN model with .Rmd files. Provided visualized results of different models. Conducted memory comparisons between different models. Wrote main.rmd file and added connections to all other functions.

Jingyi Wang - Established and optimized the Baseline model; tuned the baseline model parameters and used heatmap for visualizing its results; tuned the parameters for xgboost model under SIFT, GIST and RGB features. Wrote train, test and cross_validation functions, combined above functions with .Rmd files.

Xueyao Li - Worked on SVM model and tried linear SVM and RBF SVM; tuned parameters for SVM model and created heatmap for tuning process. Helped making presentation slides and wrote readme file. Conducted time and cv error comparison between different models.
